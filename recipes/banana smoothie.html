    <ol>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>½ to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of honey</li>
        <li>5 to 8 ice cubes</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Peel and slice the banana and put it into a blender</h3></li>
            <p>For a thicker smoothie, use a frozen banana instead. 
                If you don't have a blender, you can use a food processor fitted with metal blades.
        <li><h3>Add milk and honey</h3></li>
                <p>The more milk you use, the thinner smoothie you will get. For a thicker smoothie, 
                    use plain or vanilla yogurt instead.</p>
        <li><h3>Top it off with ice, if desired</h3></li>
                <p>If you are using frozen bananas, 
                    then you can skip the ice cubes—unless 
                    you like really thick smoothies.</p>
        <li><h3>Blend the ingredients until everything is smooth and 
            evenly combined</h3></li>
            <p>There should be no lumps or clumps. From time to time,
                 you may have to pause the blender, open it up, and push the 
                ingredients down the sides with a rubber spatula.</p>
        <li><h3>Pour and serve</h3></li>
        <p>You can enjoy it as it is, or you can garnish it 
            with a dollop of whipped cream,
             banana slices, or a drizzle of honey.</p>
    </ol>
